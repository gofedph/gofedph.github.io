      <h3>Vision statement</h3>
      <p><strong>We envision the Philippine Go community united around the shared mission of establishing and nurturing groups, school clubs, and organizations and fostering relationships between them across the country, maintaining a strong, deep relationship with the international Go community, while playing and promoting Go in the spirit of sportsmanship, safety, inclusivity, fairness, and equality.</strong></p>

      <h3>Vision statement (abbreviated)</h3>
      <p><em>A united Philippine Go community that grows through new groups and connections, plays and promotes Go with sportsmanship and inclusion, and stays closely tied to the international Go community.</em></p>

      <h3>Vision statement (structured)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>We envision the <strong>Philippine Go community</strong> united around a <strong>shared mission</strong>.</li>
        <li>That mission: <strong>establishing and nurturing</strong> groups, school clubs, and organizations and <strong>fostering relationships between them</strong> across the country.</li>
        <li><strong>Maintaining</strong> a strong, deep relationship with the <strong>international Go community</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>Playing and promoting Go</strong> in the spirit of sportsmanship, safety, inclusivity, fairness, and equality.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Vision narrative</h3>
      <p>A united community: groups, school clubs, and organizations in many places, aligned around the shared mission. We establish and nurture groups and communities—so we grow—and we foster relationships between them; we help schools jumpstart their own Go clubs. We play with respect, fairness, and goodwill and aim for a strong, deep relationship with the international Go community—with players who represent the Philippines.</p>

      <h3>Key themes / pillars</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>United community, shared mission</strong> — Groups, school clubs, and organizations moving together by choice.</li>
        <li><strong>Groups, school clubs, and organizations</strong> — We establish and nurture groups and communities (including helping schools jumpstart their own Go clubs) and we foster relationships between them nationwide—so the community grows.</li>
        <li><strong>Safety, inclusivity, fairness, and equality</strong> — We promote a safe environment; inclusivity—welcoming all groups, people, and places; fairness; and equality for all in the community.</li>
        <li><strong>Sportsmanship</strong> — Play with respect, fairness, and goodwill.</li>
        <li><strong>Strong, deep relationship with the international Go community</strong> — Learn, contribute, players represent the Philippines (e.g. IGF, AGF).</li>
        <li><strong>Good governance</strong> — Clear structure and fair governance so the federation and communities thrive.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>How the vision guides us</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Why we exist:</strong> united community → establish and nurture groups and communities, foster relationships between them, help schools jumpstart Go clubs → safety, inclusivity, fairness, equality, sportsmanship → <strong>strong internal ties</strong> and <strong>strong external ties</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>Strong internal ties</strong> — Among groups, school clubs, and organizations across the Philippines; we establish, nurture, and connect them so the community grows together.</li>
        <li><strong>Strong external ties</strong> — With the international Go community (e.g. IGF, AGF); we learn, contribute, and have players represent the Philippines.</li>
        <li>Decisions support that unity and the shared mission—not division. Tactics and metrics live in Mission and OKRs.</li>
      </ul>
